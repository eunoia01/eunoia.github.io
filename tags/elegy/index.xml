        <description>&lt;img src="/p/dead-lover/atree.jpg" alt="Featured image of post To the dead" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To, the dead&lt;br&gt;
The flavoured peppermint you saved for me&lt;br&gt;
still stinks my mouth. The laced bracelet&lt;br&gt;
also remain hanged tighted to the rose&lt;br&gt;
canvas you painted, just to keep our room&lt;br&gt;
lively and vibrant. There are some crystal&lt;br&gt;
pebbles lying in the backyard which were&lt;br&gt;
left from the ones bought to decorate your&lt;br&gt;
grave bright. I didn&amp;rsquo;t change the doormat&lt;br&gt;
cause it has your footsteps stored.&lt;br&gt;
The sunflower plants in the garden too are&lt;br&gt;
dying for I want no water to drain them&lt;br&gt;
ranting my sorrows, also there is less of&lt;br&gt;
sunlight strength watching them, like you&lt;br&gt;
did. The books in the shelf are weekly&lt;br&gt;
cleaned, inside your vinyl vase I found your&lt;br&gt;
secret letters to me, but I never opened it&lt;br&gt;
thinking &amp;ldquo;If it stayed with you, it should still&lt;br&gt;
remain the same without you&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
/My diary doesn&amp;rsquo;t have space for love&lt;br&gt;
anymore/&lt;br&gt;
Its so often I think about you, which is&lt;br&gt;
pretty much like remembering my old self,&lt;br&gt;
just because I know myself better with you.&lt;br&gt;
I am still trying to get me back. All the&lt;br&gt;
things you left behind are just pain and&lt;br&gt;
scars that kills me telling you are gone, but&lt;br&gt;
that makes me feel I am alive.&lt;br&gt;
The shoddy garland need not stay, because&lt;br&gt;
you are perfect without its pay.&lt;br&gt;
Writing to you makes me sleep,&lt;br&gt;
as the silence traps all the heat.&lt;br&gt;
Good Night, sleep heavy.&lt;br&gt;
/&amp;ldquo;Have I written to a dead lover, again?&lt;br&gt;
Okay!! Sounds better than the earlier sweet&lt;br&gt;
one on your proposal&amp;rdquo;/&lt;/p&gt;
